          I'm currently a student in my Senior year studying Computer Science at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
          At the moment I am expected to graduate in the Spring of 2023.
          My interest in programming stems from my avid use of technology in daily life.
          I began programming as a way to create things that help me in all different facets of life, and I'm passionate about using my knowledge to help others as well.

          Besides programming my hobbies include: travel, basketball, weightlifting, gaming, and visiting art museums. I have a minor in Art History.
