                <p>
                  I have over 3 years of experience working with C#. In my work at Foresight, 
                  C# was the primary language used for back-end development. I have additional experience with the language from my Software Development class,
                  as well as some of my projects such as (Clue solver).

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>
                  Java was the first language I learned. While I have not used it as much recently, I consider myself proficient in it due to
                  using it in many classes as well as in some of my early basic personal projects.

                <p>
                  I have some familiarity with python. It was briefly used in my time at Foresight as part of an in-house app until that app was discontinued.
                  My first working version of (Clue Solver) was also created in python.

                  Vue.js is one of the newer frameworks I've learned. It was used as the primary front-end framework for building this website!
